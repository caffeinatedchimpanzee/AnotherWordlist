# AnotherWordlist
a wordlist (mostly rockyou but a few other ones as well) with acompanying hashes
formatted with 5 columns starting from the left, sha 1 sums, sha 512 sums, sha 256 sums, md5 sums, passwords. just search for the hash you have with grep or awk or whatever and then look for the password, if its in the list its a lot faster than using a cracking tool.
